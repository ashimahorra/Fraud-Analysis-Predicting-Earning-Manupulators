# Fraud-Analysis-Predicting-Earning-Manupulators
Predicting Earning manupulators using data purchsed from the Harvard Publishing page (https://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/import/ptos/67020814). The eight financial indices of the Beneish Model have been used to predict earning manipulators by Indian firms using Machine Learning algorithms. The models have been compared with the Beneish model seeking a model more suitable for Indian and unbalanced data. The numbers of earnings manipulators are usually very low compared to non-manipulators and thus the data is likely to be an unbalanced data. Unbalanced data has been treated by SMOTE for better performance and accuracy.
